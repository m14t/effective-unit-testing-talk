# Effective Unit Testing

## Matt's guidelines:

1. Don't mock to much
2. Assertions should test code, not mocks
3. Breaking changes should break tests
4. Separate "pure" code from side-effects
5. Your Unit tests should not look exactly like your code
6. Test functionality (inputs and outputs), not implementation
